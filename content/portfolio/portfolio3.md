On ongoing project of mine, taking inspriation from Monzo's budgeting burndown feature. I'm building this web app with Ruby-on-Rails, and using the GoCardless API to handle linking user's bank accounts to the app securely.

So far, I am building the MVP, and have implemented functionality to link a bank account with the app, and to store the user's key to access their bank account data using server-side sessions, which are much more secure than cookies sesion storage.
