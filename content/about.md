**Welcome to my digital garden!**

        <p>This is a space for me to post notes, research, and longer articles on a varitey of subjects- mostly keeping within tech.

        <p>Recently, I'm challenging myself to learn rust, using techniques from [Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/). So far, I've completed 42/96 problems from the [ðŸ¦€ Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) problem set. Rust is a facinating language, and I'm really excited about the speed-up it can bring to production ML.

        I'm also learning about [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API), a performant API that lets web browser applications get near-native speeds by providing access to the GPU. This is a cutting-edge technology, and I think it has really big ramifications for on-deivce ML. I wrote an article introducing AI in the browser- you can read it [here](https://jwhogg.github.io/articles/ml_inference_browser/).
